## Summary

A story about nuances of crossword puzzles, told through the lens of the Oreo. Anchor around the recent viral [controversy](https://time.com/5871704/erik-agard-usatoday-crossword-diversity/) where it was clued as a â€œCookie that some people eat with mustard". Go deep explain why it is so common (letter frequency, filler words), why they used this clue, the variations of clues, how things have changed over time.

## Proof

OREO has been an answer over 3,000 times (including use as a prefix, not related to the cookie) in our database of 6 million crossword puzzle clues. It is in the top 50 of all answers, and the top-ranking brand name.

## Misc Ideas

- slider (just piles of oreos = minutes)
- not sponsored by Oreos (DM me if you are Oreos and would like to)
